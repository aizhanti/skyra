### 💾 Installing
First clone the repository

```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/rogerrogerv/cc12line.git

# then go into the repository
$ cd cc12line
```
Next install the dependencies
```bash
$ npm install
```
Start the back-end server
```bash
$ npm run dev
```
Then start the front end server for development by running:
```bash
$ npm start
``` 
Then open up your favourite web browser and go to: **https://localhost:< port >**  ⬅ you'll see the port number assigned in the console.
The page will reload if you make edits and you'll also see any lint errors in the console.

To build the app for production to the `build` folder.<br />
```bash
npm run build
```
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br />
Your app is ready to be deployed!
